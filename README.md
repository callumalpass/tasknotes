## Overview

Each task is a full Markdown note with structured metadata in YAML frontmatter. This means your tasks have all the benefits of regular notes - linking, tagging, graph view, and unlimited content - while still working as structured data for filtering and organization.

The plugin supports time tracking, recurring tasks, calendar integration with external ICS feeds, and integration with the Obsidian Bases plugin.

## Why YAML Frontmatter?

YAML is a standard data format that works with many tools, so you can easily extract and transform your task data into other formats. This keeps your data portable and aligns with Obsidian's file-over-app philosophy.

The frontmatter is extensibleâ€”add custom fields like "assigned-to" or "attachments" and use tools like Obsidian Bases to work with that data. This flexibility makes features like time-tracking natural, since there's an obvious place to store timing information.

Each task being a full note means you can write descriptions, jot down thoughts as you work, and connect tasks to other notes through Obsidian's linking and graph features. Bases integration provides custom views on your task data.

## HTTP API

TaskNotes includes an optional HTTP API server for external integrations. This enables creating tasks from browsers, automation tools, mobile apps, and custom scripts.

### Quick Start

1. Enable the HTTP API in Settings â†’ HTTP API tab (desktop only)
2. Configure port (default: 8080) and optional auth token  
3. Restart Obsidian to start the server

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# List all tasks
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks

# Create a task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "New task", "priority": "High"}'

# Get task statistics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/stats
```

### Browser Integration

The API enables browser integrations:
- **Bookmarklets** for one-click task creation from any webpage
- **Browser extensions**: [for example](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotesbrowser-extension)
- **Automation** with Zapier, IFTTT, and similar services

### Documentation

See [HTTP API Documentation](./docs/HTTP_API.md) for complete endpoint reference and integration examples.
