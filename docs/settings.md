# Settings

TaskNotes settings are organized into tabs. Each tab controls a different part of plugin behavior.


## General

The General tab controls task identification, storage locations, and task-card click behavior. Use this tab when your vault already has conventions such as custom tags, property-based identification, or specific folder structures.

For more information, see the [General Settings](settings/general.md) documentation.

## Task Properties

Task Properties defines the schema TaskNotes writes to frontmatter, including status, priority, dates, reminders, projects, and user fields. Each property card lets you remap key names and behavior so TaskNotes can match existing metadata rather than forcing a migration.

For more detailed information, see the [Task Properties Settings](settings/task-properties.md) documentation.

## Modal Fields

Modal Fields controls the task create/edit experience by deciding which fields are visible and in what order. If your workflow depends on a handful of fields, you can surface only those and reduce form noise.

For more information, see the [Modal Fields Settings](settings/modal-fields.md) documentation.

## Appearance & UI

Appearance & UI handles task card density, calendar defaults, time formatting, and visual toggles for supporting widgets. Use this tab to tune how much information is visible at a glance.

For more detailed information, see the [Appearance & UI Settings](settings/appearance.md) documentation.

## Features

Features groups behavior toggles for inline tasks, natural language input, Pomodoro, reminders, and performance-related options. It is where you enable advanced workflow capabilities and then refine defaults.

For more information, see the [Features Settings](settings/features.md) documentation.

## Integrations

Integrations covers external connectivity: Bases view wiring, Google/Microsoft OAuth calendar sync, ICS subscriptions, automatic ICS export, HTTP API settings, and webhook endpoints.

For more detailed information, see the [Integrations Settings](settings/integrations.md) documentation.
