# Settings

TaskNotes provides extensive configuration options through a tabbed settings interface. The settings system allows you to customize every aspect of the plugin's behavior, from basic task defaults to advanced field mapping and visual customization.

## Settings Organization

The settings interface is organized into eight main categories:

**Task Defaults**: Core task settings, folder management, and default values for new tasks
**Inline Tasks**: Editor integration settings for task widgets and conversion features
**Calendar**: Calendar view configurations, time settings, and display preferences
**Performance**: Options to optimize plugin performance for large vaults
**Field Mapping**: Customize YAML property names to match your existing vault structure
**Statuses**: Define custom status workflows with colors and completion behavior
**Priorities**: Configure priority levels with weights and visual styling
**Pomodoro**: Timer settings, automation options, and session management

## Configuration Approach

TaskNotes settings follow these principles:

**Sensible Defaults**: All settings include default values that work well for most users
**Immediate Application**: Most setting changes take effect immediately without requiring restart
**Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid configurations and provides clear error messages
**Flexibility**: Extensive customization options accommodate different workflows and vault structures
