# TaskNotes 3.20.0

## New Features

### Task Organization and Filtering

**Folder-Based Task Filtering** - Added task filtering by folder location with dropdown selection of vault folder paths, special handling for root-level tasks, and support for contains/empty operators. *Addresses issue #369 reported by kmaustral*

**Dynamic Task Folder Organization** - Added template variable support for default task folder setting with task variables (`{{context}}`, `{{project}}`, `{{priority}}`, `{{status}}`, `{{title}}`) and date variables (`{{year}}`, `{{month}}`, `{{day}}`, `{{date}}`). Supports automatic folder creation and title sanitization. *Addresses feature request #376 by Mara-Li*

**Archive Task Organization** - Added optional bidirectional task movement between archive folder and default tasks folder. Disabled by default with settings in Task defaults â†’ Task organization (`moveArchivedTasks`, `archiveFolder`). *Addresses feature request #402 by anareaty*

### Enhanced UI and Controls

**Enhanced Filter Bar** - Improved filter bar with instant badge updates, right-click clear functionality, "Clear All Filters" button, and better UI synchronization across main and subtask views. *Contributed by renatomen*

**Collapsible Groups** - Added collapsible groups with persisted state, chevron indicators, and keyboard navigation. Works with all grouping options while preserving wikilink functionality. Extended to subtask widget with consistent behavior. *Contributed by renatomen*

**Expand/Collapse All Controls** - Added "Expand All" and "Collapse All" buttons to task list toolbar that appear when grouping is active. *Contributed by renatomen*

**Configurable UI Elements** - Added settings for subtask chevron position (right/left) and saved views button positioning in task view toolbar. *Contributed by renatomen*

### Advanced API Architecture

Refactored HTTP API from monolithic design to controller/service pattern, reducing HTTPAPIService from 1,061 to 231 lines (78% reduction). Added dedicated controllers for tasks, time tracking, Pomodoro, system, and webhooks with 100% backward compatibility.

## Improvements

### UI and Visual Enhancements

**TaskNotes Branding** - Added custom TaskNotes icons throughout interface and edit task modal headers with new SVG assets.

**Button Styling** - Fixed agenda view and filter popup button backgrounds with improved styling consistency.

### Technical Improvements

**Settings Architecture** - Decomposed monolithic settings.ts into focused modules: defaults, settings management, type definitions, and utilities for better maintainability.

**Documentation** - Added extensive webhook documentation in `docs/examples/webhook-transforms/` with Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and custom integration examples. Expanded API documentation with complete endpoint reference, examples, error handling, authentication, and OpenAPI specification.

## Bug Fixes

**Mobile Modal Close Button** - Fixed close button (X) touch event handling in task edit modals on mobile devices, particularly Android. *Addresses issue #404 reported by anareaty*

**Test Suite Stabilization** - Resolved test failures and linting errors, improving code quality from 39 critical linting errors to 0. Test suites improved from 17 passed/40 failed to 56 passed/1 skipped (810 individual tests passed).

**HTTP API Field Consistency** - Updated API examples to use correct 'details' field instead of deprecated 'notes' field. *Addresses issue #393*

**Missing Webhook Trigger** - Added webhook trigger for recurring task completion events.
