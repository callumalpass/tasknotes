Example:

```
## Fixed

- (#768) Fixed calendar view appearing empty in week and day views due to invalid time configuration values
  - Added time validation in settings UI with proper error messages and debouncing
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'years')" error from FullCalendar
  - Thanks to @userhandle for reporting and help debugging
```

When a change has user-facing documentation, include a canonical tasknotes.dev link:

```
## Added

- Added materialized occurrence notes for recurring tasks. See [Recurring Tasks](https://tasknotes.dev/features/recurring-tasks/#materialized-occurrence-notes) for setup and calendar behavior.
```

-->

## Fixed

- (#2478) Fixed Instant Task Convert, the convert button and several other features not loading in 4.16.0 when the Daily Notes core plugin's "New file location" folder does not exist. The command reported "Task conversion service is not available." A missing daily notes folder is now treated as having no daily notes, and a feature that fails to start no longer stops the others from loading
  - Thanks to @mihihihih for reporting this
- (#2484) Fixed collapsed Kanban columns expanding again after Obsidian restarts or the view reloads. Collapsed columns are now saved in the view's `.base` configuration, like column order. See [Collapsing Columns](https://tasknotes.dev/views/kanban-view/#collapsing-columns)
  - Thanks to @UniCode9696 for reporting this
