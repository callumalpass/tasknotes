Example:

```
## Fixed

- (#768) Fixed calendar view appearing empty in week and day views due to invalid time configuration values
  - Added time validation in settings UI with proper error messages and debouncing
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'years')" error from FullCalendar
  - Thanks to @userhandle for reporting and help debugging
```

When a change has user-facing documentation, include a canonical tasknotes.dev link:

```
## Added

- Added materialized occurrence notes for recurring tasks. See [Recurring Tasks](https://tasknotes.dev/features/recurring-tasks/#materialized-occurrence-notes) for setup and calendar behavior.
```

-->

## Fixed

- (#2033) Clicking the project (folder) badge on a task card no longer shows "Project subtask filtering not available" — a dead action left over from an earlier internal change, while its tooltip still advertised filtering. The badge now expands or collapses the task's inline subtask list, and its tooltip has been corrected to match.
  - Thanks to @abbiefalls90 for the fix.
