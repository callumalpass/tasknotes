```

## Added

- Added an opt-in build mode for downloadable interface language packs, with bundled English, validated local caching for offline use, and retry support. Ordinary builds continue bundling all supported languages. Versioned public hosting, a guarded operator publisher, and conditional-create publication tooling are available for experimental builds. Publication rejects permission errors even when identical objects already exist. See [Downloadable language packs](https://tasknotes.dev/development/language-packs/) for build configuration.

## Changed

## Removed

## Fixed

- Completed Russian and Simplified Chinese calendar attachment and migration messages that still contained English fragments.
