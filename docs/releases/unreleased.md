```

-->

## Fixed

- Fixed documentation deployment CI failures caused by `docs-builder/src/js/main.js` being excluded by a broad `.gitignore` `main.js` rule
  - Added a specific unignore rule so the docs site client script is tracked and available in GitHub Actions builds
- Reduced long-running performance risk from calendar sync token persistence by avoiding full runtime settings side-effects during background sync writes
- Prevented duplicate auto-stop time tracking listeners from accumulating when settings are reloaded or changed
- Fixed a settings Integrations listener lifecycle issue that could accumulate calendar update callbacks while the settings UI is repeatedly opened/re-rendered
- (#1630) Fixed TaskNote inline task cards ignoring centered "Readable line length" layout in Minimal theme by constraining and centering the widget in readable mode
  - Thanks to @martin-forge for reporting
- Consolidated documentation cleanup for accuracy and clarity across API, webhook, NLP, privacy, settings, and view docs (corrected outdated endpoint/behavior details, normalized current settings paths, and tightened non-release prose)
- Fixed a broken docs cross-reference from Property Types Reference to Task Properties settings
- Fixed docs site link generation so internal Markdown links resolve to route URLs instead of broken `.md` paths (for example `/views/default-base-templates/`)
- Fixed docs release-note links by building all Markdown docs pages, including pages not listed directly in sidebar nav
- Added drag-to-reorder for Kanban and Task List views, including grouped Task List moves and safer handling for swimlanes, filtered views, sparse manual-order data, and large multi-note reorders
- Improved drag-to-reorder feedback and interaction quality so drop previews stay aligned with the final result, grouped Task List sections behave more like Kanban, and interactive controls like subtask and dependency toggles remain clickable during reorder mode
- Manual ordering now uses the clearer `tasknotes_manual_order` property by default, is exposed in settings as "Manual Order", uses the i18n system for drag-related prompts, and is surfaced by default in generated Kanban, Relationships, and Tasks `.base` files where manual ordering is appropriate
- Thanks to @ac8318740 for the original drag-to-reorder groundwork in PR #1619
