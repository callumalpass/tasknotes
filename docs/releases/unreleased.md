Example:

```
## Fixed

- (#768) Fixed calendar view appearing empty in week and day views due to invalid time configuration values
  - Added time validation in settings UI with proper error messages and debouncing
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'years')" error from FullCalendar
  - Thanks to @userhandle for reporting and help debugging
```

When a change has user-facing documentation, include a canonical tasknotes.dev link:

```
## Added

- Added materialized occurrence notes for recurring tasks. See [Recurring Tasks](https://tasknotes.dev/features/recurring-tasks/#materialized-occurrence-notes) for setup and calendar behavior.
```

-->

## Added

- Custom recurrence editor now supports an "End after done [n] times" end condition: a recurring task stops advancing after it has been completed a cumulative n times, and the recurrence resumes from the most recent occurrence when instances are un-completed and the total drops below n.

## Changed

## Removed

## Fixed

- (#2389) Added the missing public [v4-to-v5 beta upgrade guide](https://tasknotes.dev/migration-v4-to-v5/), including synced-device and metadata-recovery instructions, and corrected the HTTP API authentication documentation. Thanks to @m4to-3pe for reporting the broken link.

- (#2382) Fixed Kanban settings being ignored in existing `.base` files when nested under `options:` or `config:`, including empty-column hiding and pinned columns. Newly generated default files and exported v3 views now write settings directly on each view; existing files remain unchanged. See [Kanban View](https://tasknotes.dev/views/kanban-view/#configuration). Thanks to @techwiththiru for reporting this.
