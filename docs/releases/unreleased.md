  - Thanks to @userhandle for reporting and help debugging
```

-->

## Fixed

- Fixed documentation deployment CI failures caused by `docs-builder/src/js/main.js` being excluded by a broad `.gitignore` `main.js` rule
  - Added a specific unignore rule so the docs site client script is tracked and available in GitHub Actions builds
- Reduced long-running performance risk from calendar sync token persistence by avoiding full runtime settings side-effects during background sync writes
- Prevented duplicate auto-stop time tracking listeners from accumulating when settings are reloaded or changed
- Fixed a settings Integrations listener lifecycle issue that could accumulate calendar update callbacks while the settings UI is repeatedly opened/re-rendered
- (#1630) Fixed TaskNote inline task cards ignoring centered "Readable line length" layout in Minimal theme by constraining and centering the widget in readable mode
  - Thanks to @martin-forge for reporting
- Consolidated documentation cleanup for accuracy and clarity across API, webhook, NLP, privacy, settings, and view docs (corrected outdated endpoint/behavior details, normalized current settings paths, and tightened non-release prose)
- Fixed a broken docs cross-reference from Property Types Reference to Task Properties settings
- Fixed docs site link generation so internal Markdown links resolve to route URLs instead of broken `.md` paths (for example `/views/default-base-templates/`)
- Fixed docs release-note links by building all Markdown docs pages, including pages not listed directly in sidebar nav
- Drag-to-reorder now scopes Kanban ordering to the active swimlane, initializes sparse manual ordering using the visible drag order, rebalances oversized sort keys back to compact LexoRank values, and warns before large multi-note reorder writes
- The default manual-order metadata property is now `tasknotes_order`
- Task List drag-to-reorder now blocks formula-group drops and updates list-backed group properties safely during cross-group moves
- Grouped Task List drag previews now keep the landing gap inside the hovered group instead of shifting unrelated groups
- Thanks to @ac8318740 for the original drag-to-reorder groundwork in PR #1619
