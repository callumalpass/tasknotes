## Fixed

- (#768) Fixed calendar view appearing empty in week and day views due to invalid time configuration values
  - Added time validation in settings UI with proper error messages and debouncing
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'years')" error from FullCalendar
  - Thanks to @userhandle for reporting and help debugging
```

When a change has user-facing documentation, include a canonical tasknotes.dev link:

```
## Added

- Added materialized occurrence notes for recurring tasks. See [Recurring Tasks](https://tasknotes.dev/features/recurring-tasks/#materialized-occurrence-notes) for setup and calendar behavior.
```

-->

## Added

- (#2483) Task pickers list a recurring task once, even when it has occurrence notes. Press Tab or click the occurrence count to list its notes, newest first; press Backspace in the empty search box to go back. Searching for a month or day, such as `2026-06`, also finds them. See [Materialized Occurrence Notes](https://tasknotes.dev/features/recurring-tasks/#materialized-occurrence-notes).
  - Thanks to @ac8318740 for requesting and implementing this

## Changed

- Shortened the v5 and app announcement above the release notes, removed Android tester sign-up instructions, and refreshed the plugin beta link.
- (#2486) Collapsed Kanban columns now show the column's icon and title in the collapsed strip, with the title written vertically from top to bottom and long titles cut off. Previously the title was hidden, so collapsed columns could only be told apart by their colour. See [Collapsing Columns](https://tasknotes.dev/views/kanban-view/#collapsing-columns)
  - Thanks to @UniCode9696 for the suggestion

## Fixed

- (#2484) Fixed collapsed Kanban columns expanding again after Obsidian restarts or the view reloads. Collapsed columns are now saved in the view's `.base` configuration, like column order. See [Collapsing Columns](https://tasknotes.dev/views/kanban-view/#collapsing-columns)
  - Thanks to @UniCode9696 for reporting this
