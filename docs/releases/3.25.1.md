# TaskNotes 3.25.1

## Fixed

- (#854) (#695) Fixed all-day ICS calendar events displaying on wrong day and appearing twice
  - All-day events now stored as date-only strings (YYYY-MM-DD) instead of UTC timestamps
  - Events display on correct calendar date regardless of user timezone (fixes issue in PST, EST, and other negative UTC offset timezones)
  - All-day events no longer appear twice in Agenda view
  - Updated all date parsing throughout the codebase to handle date-only format correctly
  - Maintains compatibility with FullCalendar and preserves iCalendar RFC 5545 semantics for VALUE=DATE events
  - Thanks to @needo37 for reporting #854 and @realJohnDoe for reporting #695

- (#859) Fixed multi-day task creation in Bases calendar view
  - Extracted shared task creation logic to `calendar-core.ts` for consistency between calendar views
  - Multi-day all-day selections now correctly set time estimate based on number of days dragged
  - Timed task selections (week view) now correctly calculate duration in minutes
  - Single-day clicks no longer override default time estimate settings
  - Both Bases calendar and AdvancedCalendarView now use same logic for consistent behavior
  - Fixed all-day task rendering to use 24-hour days (1440 minutes = 1 day on calendar)
  - Follows UTC Anchor principle for date-only strings
  - Thanks to @anareaty for reporting
