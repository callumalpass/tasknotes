# TaskNotes 4.1.15

Dependency links render and resolve correctly with angle-bracket markdown, restoring Blocked/Blocking badges across views.

## Fixed

- Blocked-by/Blocking entries now parse angle-bracket markdown links, show proper link labels in the task modal, and open the linked task.
- Kanban task cards again show “Blocked (n)” badges when dependencies are present.
