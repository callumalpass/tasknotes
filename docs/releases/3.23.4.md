# TaskNotes 3.23.4

## Bug Fixes

### Task Scheduling & Natural Language Processing

- Fixed Russian weekday scheduling conflict where single weekdays (e.g., "воскресенье") were incorrectly interpreted as recurring tasks instead of single-day scheduling ([#665](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/665), thanks to @anareaty for the report)
- Fixed issue where natural language processing failed to save parsed time estimates in task creation modal ([#682](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/682), thanks to @RumiaKitinari for the detailed report)
- Fixed scheduled task grouping UTC anchor regression that caused today's tasks to appear under "Past Scheduled" instead of "Today" ([#384](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/384), thanks to @jcromwell for the report)

### Settings & Configuration

- Fixed plugin failure when excluded folders setting contains trailing commas - the parsing logic now properly filters empty strings ([#664](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/664), thanks to @Yoav6 for identifying this issue)

### Calendar & Time Management

- Fixed calendar not refreshing when task duration or time tracking changes ([#382](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/382), thanks to @mdbraber)
- Fixed calendar not refreshing after task archive or move operations
- Fixed timeblock editing using stored date instead of current date for past day modifications ([#647](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/647), thanks to @RumiaKitinari)
- Fixed Pomodoro timer not preserving task context when auto-starting sessions ([#641](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/641), thanks to @RumiaKitinari)
- Fixed all-day tasks not rendering properly across multiple days in calendar view (thanks to [Danny Talks Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRavkMUYWzo) for reporting this in his video review)

### User Interface

- Fixed mini calendar header overflow issue in sidebar view ([#459](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/459), with CSS improvements suggested by @jsonshanks, thanks to @girisumit for the report)

## New Features & Enhancements

### Visual Improvements

- Added file-text icon to note cards in agenda view for better visual distinction from headers and consistency with task and calendar event icons ([#662](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/662), thanks to @ras0q for the suggestion)
- Improved mini calendar styling, interactions, and legend display
- Enhanced task dot visualization to reflect accurate matching dates

### Settings Organization

- Moved timeblocking settings to Features tab with improved usage instructions for better discoverability

## Documentation

- Updated documentation to fix auto-archiving settings reference ([#673](https://github.com/callumalpass/tasknotes/issues/673), thanks to @antonio for pointing out the inconsistency)
