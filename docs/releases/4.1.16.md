# TaskNotes 4.1.16

Kanban project cards now refresh immediately after adding a new subtask from the task edit dialog.

## Fixed

- Project cards in Kanban now show the folder/expand icon right after adding a new subtask in the edit modal.
- Project index caching is invalidated on subtask changes to ensure project status is recalculated promptly.
