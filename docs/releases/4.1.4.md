# TaskNotes 4.1.4

Focused patch to improve link handling and Kanban usability.

## Fixed

- Markdown links with angle brackets now resolve correctly throughout TaskNotes (filters, overlays, and link detection). `[Title](<path>)` behaves the same as `[Title](path)`, preventing missed project/task matches.
- Kanban columns grouped by status/priority now show the configured labels instead of the raw values, matching the UI settings.
