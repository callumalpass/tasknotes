# TaskNotes 4.1.4

This fork release consolidates all changes since upstream 4.1.3 into a single 4.1.4 patch. It focuses on link correctness, kanban usability, project/subtask handling, and quality fixes.

## Highlights

- Full support for markdown links with angle brackets in all key parsing paths: `[Title](<path>)` is treated like `[Title](path)`.
- Kanban columns now use configured status/priority labels instead of raw values.
- Manual sorting for Kanban columns and project subtasks, with persisted ranks.
- Project/subtask UX improvements (folder icon toggle, bold project titles, custom fields on subtasks).

## Added

- Manual sorting in Kanban when the only sort rule is `rankByColumn` (drag handle + persisted `rankByColumn` ranks).
- Manual subtask ordering in the edit dialog when the only sort rule is `rankByColumn` (persisted `rankByProject`).

## Improved

- Project folder icon is now the expand/collapse toggle for subtasks (no separate chevron).
- Project titles render bold on task cards (subtasks remain normal weight).
- Subtask cards inherit the same visible properties as their parent cards, including custom fields.
- Subtask lists reuse the active Bases sort rules and stay consistent even when focus changes.
- Kanban project cards refresh immediately after adding subtasks and after external deletes.
- Kanban status/priority headers use user-configured labels.

## Fixed

- Angle-bracket markdown links resolve correctly across projects, subtasks, dependency badges, overlays, and filters.
- Blocked/Blocking relationships resolve and render correctly with markdown links.
- Property-based task identification no longer injects or modifies `task`/`Task` tags when tags are not explicitly set.
- Status color now shows as a stripe on the right edge when the status property is hidden.

## Refactors / Quality

- Centralized project display-name parsing to reduce duplication and ensure consistent link handling.
- Removed verbose Bases rendering logs for better performance.
- Removed license validation console logging to avoid leaking sensitive data.
