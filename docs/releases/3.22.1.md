# TaskNotes 3.22.1

## New Features

### Configurable Recurring Task Due Date Behavior

- Added optional due date advancement for recurring tasks. When enabled, maintains the time separation between scheduled and due dates when tasks are completed. The new "Maintain due date offset in recurring tasks" setting in Misc preferences controls this behavior and defaults to disabled to preserve existing behavior. *Contributed by @jhedlund, fixes issue #470*

## Bug Fixes

### Calendar and Task Display

- Fixed calendar view issues where tasks were not displaying correctly due to empty status values causing infinite loops and TypeErrors. Resolved `timeEntries.filter is not a function` errors when loading calendar events and prevented Obsidian freezing during task creation with empty status text. *Fixes issue #520 reported by @cathywu*

### Saved Views and Property Management

- Fixed property visibility settings not being preserved when saving filter views. View configurations now properly store and restore property display preferences. *Fixes issue #545 reported by @anareaty*
- Fixed saved view selection to prefer newly created views over older matching views, ensuring the correct view is activated after saving.
- Added proper null safety checks for FilterBar interactions to prevent errors during view save operations.

### User Interface Improvements

- Added responsive behavior to filter bar buttons that automatically hide button text when pane width falls below 500px to prevent overflow in narrow sidebars. Uses container queries with media query fallback for broader browser support. *Fixes issue #549 reported by @TonyAtlas*

## Development Improvements

- Reduced excessive console logging in TaskListView by removing 37+ debug statements while preserving essential error logging for troubleshooting.
