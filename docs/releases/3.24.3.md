# TaskNotes 3.24.3

- (#776) Fixed screens failing to load with "toLowerCase is not a function" error
  - Issue occurred when frontmatter tags array contained non-string values (numbers, booleans, etc.)
  - Added type validation to filter out non-string values before processing tags
  - Valid string tags continue to work normally while invalid types are safely skipped
  - Thanks to @kmf and @Andre-Ioda for help debugging this issue
