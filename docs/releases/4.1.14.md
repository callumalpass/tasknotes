# TaskNotes 4.1.14

Angle-bracket markdown links resolve correctly across projects, subtasks, and dependency badges.
Primary clicks on project links inside task cards now open the TaskNotes detail modal; Cmd/Ctrl+click still opens the note in Obsidian.

## Fixed

- Dependency parsing now normalizes linked UIDs (including angle-bracket markdown links) for blocked/blocking relationships.
- Filter service reuses the centralized link parser with angle-bracket support.
- Project links rendered in task cards honor angle-bracket/wikilink/markdown formats and open the TaskNotes modal by default.
