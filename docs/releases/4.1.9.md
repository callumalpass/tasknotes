# TaskNotes 4.1.9

Project cards pop on Kanban without affecting subtasks.

## Fixed

- Project cards on the Kanban board now use bold titles while subtasks keep their normal weight.
- Subtask lists keep the active Bases sort even when focus moves to another pane (no more fallback to lexicographic sort mid-edit).
