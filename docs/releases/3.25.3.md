# TaskNotes 3.25.3

## Added

- (#877) Added standard Obsidian CSS classes to settings tab buttons for improved theme compatibility
  - Fixes issue where themes like Retroma couldn't distinguish active tabs
  - Thanks to @Bregor for the contribution

## Fixed

- (#899) Fixed "Folder for converted tasks" setting being hidden when convert button is disabled

  - Resolves confusion for users who convert tasks via command palette
  - Thanks to @nnnell for the fix

- (#905), (#907) Fixed project filter incorrectly affecting custom field suggestions
  - Custom field wikilink suggestions (`[[`) now show all vault files instead of only filtered projects
