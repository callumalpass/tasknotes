# TaskNotes 3.24.1

## Bug Fixes

### Task Card Widget

- Fixed task card widget appearing on all notes instead of only task notes
- Widget now properly respects task identification settings (tag or property-based)

This patch release fixes the task card widget introduced in 3.24.0 to only display on actual task notes.
