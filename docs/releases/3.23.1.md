# TaskNotes 3.23.1

## Bug Fixes

### Bases Plugin Integration

- Fixed Bases views not recognizing custom field mappings when using non-default property names. Status dots, priority colors, and dates now display correctly in Bases views when using custom field names, including Cyrillic and other localized property names. *Thanks to @anareaty for reporting this issue (#607)*
