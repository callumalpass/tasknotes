## What's New in v4

TaskNotes v4 migrates all views to the Bases system.

### Breaking Changes

- **Minimum Obsidian version: 1.10.1**
- **View commands now use Bases files** - Ribbon icons and command palette commands (Calendar, Kanban, Tasks, Agenda, Project Subtasks) now open `.base` files created automatically in your vault
- **Saved filter views** - Custom saved views can be converted to `.base` files using a conversion button in settings

## Added

### OAuth Calendar Integration

- Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook integration via OAuth 2.0
  - View and sync calendar events in Bases calendar
  - Drag events in the TaskNotes bases calendar to change the event's time online
  - Events sync every 15 minutes or upon local change
  - Requires creating your own OAuth application (approximately 15 minutes)
  - See [Calendar Setup Guide](https://callumalpass.github.io/tasknotes/calendar-setup)

### Time Entry Editor Modal

- Dedicated interface for managing time entries
  - Alt-drag on Bases calendar to create time entries

## Migration Guide

### First Launch

1. Default view files are created automatically in `TaskNotes/Views/`
2. Ribbon and command palette commands now open `.base` files
3. Review Settings → General to customize view file paths

### Converting Saved Filter Views

1. Go to Settings →  General
2. Click the conversion button to convert saved filter views to `.base` files
3. Converted views appear in a file in `TaskNotes/Views/`

### Calendar Integration (Optional)

1. Go to Settings → Integrations → OAuth Calendar Integration
