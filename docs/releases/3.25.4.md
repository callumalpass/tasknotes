# TaskNotes 3.25.4

## Added

- (#937), (#956) Added optional setting to hide identification tags in task cards
  - New "Hide identification tags in task cards" setting (only visible when using tag-based identification)
  - Hides exact matches (e.g., `#task`) and hierarchical children (e.g., `#task/project`, `#task/work/urgent`)
  - Reduces visual clutter while keeping tags in frontmatter for organizational purposes
  - Backward compatible - disabled by default
  - Thanks to @renatomen for implementing this feature and @edakimling for reporting

- (#911) Added custom field suggestion filtering
  - New `autosuggestFilter` field to `UserMappedField` interface allows filtering suggestions by current filter context
  - Added collapsible filter section in settings with visual indicator
  - Comprehensive test coverage for custom field filtering feature
  - Thanks to @renatomen for this enhancement

## Fixed

- (#903) Fixed Edit Task modal not adding completedDate when marking tasks as done
  - Edit Task modal now correctly adds completedDate when changing status to completed
  - Fixed Edit Task modal adding empty contexts and projects arrays to frontmatter
  - Behavior now consistent with other completion methods (Agenda view, widget context menu, quick actions)
  - Thanks to @nightroman for reporting

- (#969), (#967) Fixed Bases Kanban layout not displaying correctly when no groupBy is configured
  - All tasks were appearing in a single "None" column
  - Columns now appear in the order defined in TaskNotes settings (not alphabetical)
  - Detects invalid Bases grouping and falls back to status-based grouping
  - Tasks are properly distributed across status columns
  - Thanks to @mweichert for the fix and @PacoTaco2, @abuhammer for reporting
