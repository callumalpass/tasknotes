# Task Defaults

These settings control the default properties for new tasks, as well as the file management and template settings.

## Folder and File Management

You can specify a **Default Tasks Folder** where all new tasks will be created. You can also configure the **Task Tag** that identifies notes as TaskNotes, and you can specify a list of **Excluded Folders** that will be ignored by the plugin.

TaskNotes also provides a flexible system for **Filename Generation**. You can choose from a variety of patterns, including title-based, timestamp-based, and Zettelkasten-style, or you can create your own custom filename template.

## Default Task Properties

You can set the **Default Status** and **Default Priority** for new tasks, as well as the **Default Due Date** and **Default Scheduled Date**. You can also specify default **Contexts** and **Tags** that will be automatically added to new tasks.

## Template System

TaskNotes supports **Templates** for both the YAML frontmatter and the body of your task notes. You can use templates to pre-fill common values, add boilerplate text, and create a consistent structure for your tasks. Templates can also include variables, such as `{{title}}`, `{{date}}`, and `{{parentNote}}`, which will be automatically replaced with the appropriate values when a new task is created.
