# Inline Task Settings

These settings control the behavior of TaskNotes' inline task management features, including the Task Link Overlay, Instant Task Conversion, and the natural language processor.

## Task Link Overlay

You can enable or disable the **Task Link Overlay** feature, which replaces wikilinks to task notes with interactive widgets.

## Instant Task Conversion

You can enable or disable the **Instant Task Conversion** feature, which allows you to convert checkbox tasks to TaskNotes with a single click. You can also choose whether to apply your default task settings to converted tasks.

## Project Subtasks Widget

You can enable or disable the **Project Subtasks Widget**, which displays a collapsible list of tasks that reference the current note as a project. When enabled, the widget appears automatically in project notes and updates in real-time as tasks are modified.

## Natural Language Processing

You can enable or disable the **Natural Language Processor (NLP)**, which allows you to create tasks using conversational language. You can also set the default date type for ambiguous date references.
