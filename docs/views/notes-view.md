# Notes View (Legacy)

This page documents the legacy Notes View from earlier TaskNotes versions.

## Current Status

In current v4 Bases-first workflows, Notes View is not part of the default view command/file set.

Use these v4 alternatives instead:

- `views/calendar-views.md` for schedule-centric planning
- `views/agenda-view.md` for list-style near-term planning
- `views/default-base-templates.md` to customize `.base` files

## Legacy Behavior Reference

Historically, Notes View listed non-task notes by date using note indexing.
If you are migrating older docs or saved workflows, verify behavior in your current plugin version before relying on this page.
