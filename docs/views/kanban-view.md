# Kanban View

The Kanban View displays tasks as cards in columns, where each column represents a different status. This provides a visual way to manage your workflow, similar to tools like Trello or Jira.

## Interface Layout

The Kanban View consists of a set of columns, each corresponding to a status in your configured workflow. Tasks are displayed as cards within the appropriate column. You can move tasks between columns by dragging and dropping them, which will automatically update the task's status.

## Task Cards

Each task card displays key information about the task, such as its title, priority, and due date. You can click on a card to open the task for editing, or you can use the context menu to perform a variety of actions.
