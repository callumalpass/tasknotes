# Calendar Views

TaskNotes provides two calendar-based views for visualizing and managing your tasks: the **Mini Calendar** and the **Advanced Calendar**.

## Mini Calendar View

The Mini Calendar is a compact, month-based view that shows which days have tasks. It's designed for quick navigation and for providing an at-a-glance overview of your task distribution.

## Advanced Calendar View

The Advanced Calendar is a full-featured calendar with multiple view modes (month, week, and day), drag-and-drop scheduling, and time-blocking capabilities. You can create new tasks by clicking on dates or time slots, and you can reschedule tasks by dragging them to a new date or time.
