# Agenda View

The Agenda View displays a chronological list of tasks and notes, sorted by their due and scheduled dates.

## Content Organization

The Agenda View groups tasks and notes by time. The default groups are "Overdue," "Today," "Tomorrow," "This Week," "Next Week," and "Later." Within each group, items are sorted by priority.

## Focus Features

The view provides controls for the date range and for the display of completed tasks. It also uses visual styling to distinguish overdue and high-priority items.
