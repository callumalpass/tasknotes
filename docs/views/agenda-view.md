# Agenda View

The Agenda View displays a chronological list of tasks and notes, sorted by their due and scheduled dates.

## FilterBar Integration

The Agenda View includes the same FilterBar functionality as the Task List View, allowing you to filter, sort, and save views of your tasks. See the [Task List View](task-list.md) documentation for complete FilterBar functionality details.

## Content Organization

The Agenda View groups tasks and notes by time. The default groups are "Overdue," "Today," "Tomorrow," "This Week," "Next Week," and "Later." Within each group, items are sorted by priority.

## Focus Features

The view provides controls for the date range and for the display of completed tasks. It also uses visual styling to distinguish overdue and high-priority items.
