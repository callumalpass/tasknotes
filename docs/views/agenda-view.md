# Agenda View

The Agenda View provides a focused, chronological list of upcoming tasks and notes sorted by due dates and scheduled dates. It's designed for daily and weekly planning, helping you see what needs attention in the near term.

## Content Organization

**Chronological Sorting**: Tasks and notes are sorted primarily by due date, with scheduled date as a secondary sort criterion.

**Time-Based Groupings**:
- **Overdue**: Tasks past their due dates, highlighted for immediate attention
- **Today**: Tasks and notes due or scheduled for today
- **Tomorrow**: Tasks and notes for the next day
- **This Week**: Tasks and notes due within the current week  
- **Next Week**: Tasks and notes for the following week
- **Later**: Tasks and notes beyond the next week

**Priority Within Groups**: Within each time grouping, items are sub-sorted by priority level to highlight the most important items.

## Interface Features

**Clean Layout**: Minimal interface focused on task content without distracting elements.

**Essential Information**: Each item shows:
- Title with link to full note
- Due and/or scheduled dates
- Priority indicator (for tasks)
- Status indicator (for tasks)
- Key contexts and tags

**Visual Hierarchy**: Different styling for overdue, urgent, and future items helps with quick prioritization.

## Focus Features

**Date Range Control**: Adjust how far into the future the agenda extends:
- Today only
- Next 3 days
- Next week
- Next month
- Custom range

**Completion Handling**: Options for how completed tasks are displayed:
- Hide completed tasks entirely
- Show completed tasks with strikethrough
- Show completed tasks in separate section

**Urgency Highlighting**: Visual emphasis on:
- Overdue tasks (red highlighting)
- Tasks due today (distinct styling) 
- High-priority tasks (bold or colored text)

## Quick Actions

**Inline Task Management**:
- Mark tasks complete with checkbox interaction
- Change priority or status with quick selectors
- Edit due dates with date picker
- Add or modify contexts and tags

**Individual Task Management**: Tasks can be managed through context menus and quick actions without leaving the agenda view.

## Planning Integration

**Daily Planning Workflow**: Use the Agenda View as part of daily planning routines:
1. Review overdue tasks and reschedule or complete
2. Check today's tasks and prioritize
3. Preview tomorrow's work for preparation
4. Identify potential scheduling conflicts

**Weekly Review**: Extend the date range to see the full week ahead and balance workload across days.

**Capacity Planning**: Visual density of tasks per day helps identify overloaded periods.

## Filtering and Customization

**Standard Filters**: Apply filters for status, priority, contexts, and tags to focus on specific types of work.

**Context-Specific Views**: Filter by context to see location-based or tool-specific tasks.

**Project Focus**: Use tag filtering to view agenda items for specific projects or areas of responsibility.

**Workload Balancing**: Hide or de-emphasize certain task types to focus on critical path items.

## Performance and Responsiveness

**Efficient Loading**: Only loads tasks within the specified date range for optimal performance.

**Real-Time Updates**: Changes to task dates or properties immediately update the agenda display.

**Keyboard Navigation**: Support for keyboard shortcuts to navigate through dates and tasks efficiently.
