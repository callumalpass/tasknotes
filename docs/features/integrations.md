[← Back to Features](../features.md)

## Bases

TaskNotes integrates with the [Bases plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-bases). This allows you to use your tasks as a data source in your Bases databases.

### Features

- **Task Views**: TaskNotes provides two views for Bases: "Task List" and "Kanban".
- **Task Properties**: Task properties are displayed on the task cards in the Bases views.
- **Formula Computation**: Use Bases formulas to perform calculations on your task data.

### Getting Started

To use the Bases integration, you need to have both the TaskNotes and Bases plugins installed and enabled.

1.  **Enable the Integration**: Open **Settings → TaskNotes → Integrations** and enable the "Bases integration" toggle (restart Obsidian after changing this setting).
2.  **Create a View**: In Bases, create a new view and select either the "TaskNotes Task List" or "TaskNotes Kanban" view.

Your tasks will now be available in the Bases view.
