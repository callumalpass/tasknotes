# Calendar Integration

TaskNotes provides calendar integration features, which allow you to visualize your tasks and schedule your work. This is done through two calendar views and the ability to subscribe to external calendar feeds.

## Calendar Views

TaskNotes has two calendar views for visualizing and managing tasks: the **Mini Calendar** and the **Advanced Calendar**.

The **Mini Calendar** is a compact, month-based view that provides an overview of which days have tasks. It is designed for navigation and for understanding task distribution.

The **Advanced Calendar** is a calendar with multiple view modes (month, week, and day), drag-and-drop scheduling, and time-blocking capabilities. You can create new tasks by clicking on dates or time slots, and you can reschedule tasks by dragging them to a new date or time.

## ICS Calendar Subscriptions

TaskNotes can subscribe to external calendar feeds using the iCalendar (ICS) format. This allows you to display events from services like Google Calendar and Outlook alongside your tasks. You can add and manage your calendar subscriptions in the plugin's settings.

## Time-blocking

The Advanced Calendar supports time-blocking, which is a time management method that involves scheduling out parts of your day. You can create time blocks directly in the calendar, and you can link them to specific tasks. Time blocks are stored in the frontmatter of your daily notes.
