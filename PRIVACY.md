# TaskNotes Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 12, 2025

## Overview

TaskNotes is an Obsidian plugin that helps you manage tasks within your notes.

## Data Collection and Usage

TaskNotes does not collect, transmit, or share any of your data.

## Data Storage

- All task and note data remains local to your Obsidian vault
- Plugin settings are stored locally in Obsidian's configuration
- No data is sent to external servers or third parties

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time:
- Disable the plugin to stop processing tasks
- Remove the plugin to delete all plugin settings
- Your notes remain in your Obsidian vault under your control

## Network Requests (Optional Features)

TaskNotes operates locally by default, but includes optional features that make network requests when you enable them:

**Optional network features:**
- **ICS Calendar Subscriptions**: If you configure calendar subscriptions, TaskNotes fetches calendar data from the URLs you provide (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook)
- **Webhooks**: If you configure webhooks, TaskNotes sends task event data to the webhook URLs you specify

**What we never do:**
- No analytics or tracking
- No telemetry data collection
- No external network requests to TaskNotes servers (we don't have any servers)
